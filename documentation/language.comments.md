### Comments
Comments are non-executable tokens used to annotate code.

#### Regular Comments
Regular comments begin with `#` followed by whitespace and continue until the end of the line. 

```
# This is a regular comment
```

#### Block Comments
Block comments begin and end with matching sequences of two or more `#` characters. The opening delimiter must be followed by whitespace, and the closing delimiter must be preceded by whitespace.

```
## This is a block comment.
   It can span multiple lines. ##

name = ## They can also be used inline ## "Utkrisht"
```


Different delimiter lengths allow block comments to be nested.
```
#### 
The comment starts here

## contains a nested comment ##

and ends here. 
####
```



#### Documentation Comments
Documentation comments are used to document variables.

They are written using regular single-line comments placed directly above the declaration. Their contents are treated as plain text and do not require any special syntax.

> [!TIP]
> You can use Markdown, XML, or any other format supported by your IDE or documentation tool inside documentation comments.
